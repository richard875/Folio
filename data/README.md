# Feed catalog

Edit **`feeds.json`** to configure feed collection. It is bundled into the server;
rebuild/redeploy production after changes. Research documents are not data sources.

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `site` | Publisher label, e.g. `WSJ` |
| `section` | Collection grouping; currently `Main feed` |
| `url` | Complete HTTP(S) feed URL, without credentials |
| `ordering` | `editorial`, `newest`, `google-ranked`, or `feed` |
| `format` | `rss` (RSS/Atom) or `news-sitemap` |
| `homepageScore` | Optional number from 0 to 10; coverage weight, not article importance |
| `edition` | Optional informational label |

The first five fields are required. Unknown fields and invalid entries fail
validation. Duplicate site/section/URL entries keep their first position.
`format` describes the source; the XML parser still detects its actual structure.
`editorial` preserves curated order, `newest`/`google-ranked` use freshness and
coverage ranking, and `feed` uses the existing publisher-profile fallback.

This catalog does not configure article-retrieval services. For those, edit
`reader/retrieval.config.ts` and `reader/methods.ts`.

The catalog is configuration, not a collected report. Link reports are saved and
returned as versioned JSON under `output/links/`; each publisher/section contains
`articles: { url, summary? }[]`. See the [report format and summary rules](../scripts/fetch-links.md).
Saved article files remain Markdown by default, with JSON optional.
